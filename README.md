## Backend

### Django
Django, a high-level Python Web framework, forms the backbone of our backend. It follows the model-template-views architectural pattern, making it a robust framework for our application.

### Django Authentication
We use Django's built-in authentication system for user login, registration, and management. It provides a secure way to handle user accounts and passwords.

### Django Rest Framework
Django Rest Framework (DRF) is used for building APIs. DRF provides a flexible, web-browsable API and tools for handling serialize/deserialize operations, which are essential for our RESTful web service.

### Simple JWT
We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure transmission of information between parties. JWT allows us to securely transmit information encoded as a JSON object.

## Frontend

### Next.js
Next.js, a React framework, is used for building our frontend. It provides features like server-side rendering and generating static websites, which are essential for our project.

### TypeScript
We use TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, to catch errors early in the development process. It provides a safer and more efficient coding environment.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, is used for styling our application. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs.

### Shadcn UI
Shadcn UI is a UI library that we use for our user interface components. It provides a set of high-quality React components out of the box.

### Next.js Middleware
We use Next.js middleware for route protection. It allows us to run code server-side before rendering the page, providing a secure way to protect routes.
